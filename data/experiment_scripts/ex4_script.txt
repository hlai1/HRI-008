[Start of Game]
[Start of video 1 (ex4_0)]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Cause any one of us does anyone of us have a miami card?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: No. I have an Atlanta though

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: but i can hop right in there and get rid of that in my first turn

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: mmm.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: or you can do it to, because you’re the dispatcher you can move me over there.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: I was also thinking if we can get one more yellow card, then i can just cure all the yellow ones.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Okay

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh cause you have all the yellow ones.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: But where

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: I think

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: you have to be in the city

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: you have to have a research station, but I have a card

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: what if you guys stay in atlanta for the first move, and then

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: don’t we have to be, we have to be in the city of the card if I understand correctly

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: I think we also have to put a research center there

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so one good thing is the Bogeta, that card is a yellow, but you could cure it maybe while you are there

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: so

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: okay so what i could really do is not, well the other problem is I have to discard there and I need more cards to cure it.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: oh.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I wonder if there are certain stipulations for you curing it or if its just once your there

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: once I’m there I can like remove all cubes of a single color so i can just do my treat the city thing and get rid of all of the cubes

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B [R]: yeah, just get rid of like

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I should try to I think my goal would be to chase the highest cubed places and while you guys try to coordinate getting all the cards together

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: research stations and cards

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah, that sounds good

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: and then you would dispatch, so you can just bring people places, oh that’s cool, you can just bring me to Bogeta and we wouldn’t have to discard

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: but we still would have to put a research station there

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: oh so that

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: well, i think that he can, he can move

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: then we can all cure all of the blocks or um.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: What happens when you have a cure?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: when you have a cure you completely remove all of the blocks and I don’t think it can reinfect

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: oh perfect, no probably not otherwise it would have been mentioned

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: right?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: I hope not

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so for the research station, what’s the point in having it there?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: i think you need it there

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: you have to be in the city to do the cure

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: oh okay

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: you have to be in the city at the research station to make the cure so you have to have the four cards be in the city and then you can cure it

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: yeah you have to have a research station in the city and then you have to have four cards, or I have to have four cards, you have to have five cards to cure, but you can put me in a city so I don’t have to get rid of cards.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Then I can put a research, so I think he should move and get rid of some of the

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: oh i need them i need them

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: and then

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: maybe move to Lagos slowly

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: yeah and then as soon as we get another yellow card, I’ll put a research station in bogeta.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: it looks like yellow is going to be our first shot to cure and then we have the most reds after that

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so one thing is for these using these cards.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I was thinking of a strategy we could just keep turning cities for now until we get

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: wait we aren’t allowed to have zero cards?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: but i guess when this whole deck runs out we are done, so we can’t really do much.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Maybe I, because I don’t really have to be places that much, I could just go places a little bit, like I don’t want to willy nilly loose all these cards, but I could

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: you could try, you could try, you know what you can do is can you go anywhere with your power?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yes I think, so I can move your pawns as if it were mine, so on my turn I can

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: but you don’t have to have to have the city to move them?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: I

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: You have to have the city.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: one of us has to have the city, so maybe i have to have it

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: cause, do you have anything that has a on it?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Because if you did you could just move there

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: but I mean, you can move them to karachi, and then you can handle it

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: maybe that’ll be my first move to karachi.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: but wouldn’t the move be for me to cure this, and then you get me to Karachi?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Then I can clear.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: she’s first though

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I know for sure, but she can move towards, she can move towards another semi-important target.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah, but would we should we

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: if you go to a city with these, could you just do

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I can clear all the things

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: but we can only take one off

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: yeah you only take one off

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: because that’d be cool if went to these and took them down to two

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: I agree

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: so like maybe you could just move to miami and then just send patrick to Karachi?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: But then, I don’t know.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Yeah I think getting rid of these three and then getting me over there to get rid of these three would be, but we’ll see how the outbreaks go but if one of you might want to start moving over here.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Might want to start moving this way just to kinda split up.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Ooh Yeah, I think that on my turn we should all move into Miami

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: I think he can just move one over right?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I can I can get to move one over in one of my four actions.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Oh okay

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: yeah so

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: yeah so i get to move to one of those four, so I can just move here, and then uhh.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Wait, could I do four basic actions in a row?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Could I just do four adjacent cities in a row?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I think so, yeah, as long as you don’t run out of time.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Yeah, because like you could go to miami and then Elgato

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay, so then doesn’t count as an action when I cure it.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: oh, well that’s good.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: One, two, three, four.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I could technically knock all of these out I guess.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: well this one, It’s not right.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: well it’s still within

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: you’d have to stop there, right?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: One, two, three, four, four actions.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: cool

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I don’t know, I don’t know the rules.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: No no, we should win!

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So I guess, I’m going to head to Karachi, and, I don’t know, one thing I’m seeing is that we do have the Yellow disease is the problem, but if I end up here, if I build a research station, that would give us the opportunity to build up the black disease

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: MmmHmm

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so we could do that or something

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I think that’s the move

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: And I’ll do a research station somewhere in yellow.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Okay.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: So I think you can move there and do a research station, right?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: okay, so should I start the thing, are we ready?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Sure, let’s start

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh yeah, I also have to draw a card

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: at the end

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: oh yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: yeah, once the 90 seconds is up.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: ready, go.

[B’s Turn begins]
[Timer begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: pick up the orange, so I’m going to karachi, put that card there.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: Build a research station there, and then draw two of these.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: Well if your actions are over, then you can just

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: oh, okay.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: Well I have more time

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: so you did two actions now, correct

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: umm yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: So what other actions could

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: so like she could move over one more and then get rid of one

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: oh, let’s do that.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: I’ll move one square from mumbai, and then that makes four.

[Timer ends.]

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: alright then, and now draw two cards and do two.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so I have sydney and san francisco, and draw two, and cairo gets

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: you draw two, correct?
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: No just one

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: and now don’t I redraw the amount that’s there?
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: wait do you put down that many there or do you draw that many cards?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: draw two cards, oh wait no.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So we have to draw a number of infection cards equal to the current infection rate

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: okay so one more and then yeah, okay.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: toronto

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: toronto gets the blue?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I almost said tomato but that would be wrong

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Is that the end of your turn?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: yeah

[B’s turn ends]
[R’s turn begins]

[Timer starts.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: Okay, so I, I guess, should i go to caracas and build a research station?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Okay, I’m getting rid of a card

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: No, you can make two moves and get rid of two actions

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: adjacent moves I think are a good idea

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: this um, one here and then here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: and now your done, you just did four actions, two moves and two cures

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: we’re making steady progress

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: okay, and now i take two cards?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: mmhmm

[Timer ends.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Oh, goody, uh, and then I draw two of these?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Okay, so moscow and sao paulo.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Okay, go ahead

[R’s turn ends]
[G’s turn begins]

[Timer starts.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: cure all, and then cure one move cure.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: and one move cure.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: I did my thing.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: I did the medic thing.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: okay

[Timer ends.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: oh, draw two, aw I wanted two specials.

[Epidemic card drawn]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Aw I have an epidemic card, so move infect rate by one, draw a card off the bottom of the infection draw pile and infect the indicated city with three cubes
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: uhh, Algier

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: research station

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: and then discard a card

[End of video 1 (ex4_0)]
[Beginning of video 2 (ex4_1)]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Um, shuffle the infection discard pile and place it on top of the infection pile.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Oh um I have to shuffle this and put it back on top of the pile.

[End of G’s turn]
[Beginning of B’s turn]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Maybe I should move patrick over here?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I’m allowed to move any pawn

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: To where

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: to anywhere, I can start the timer.

[Timer starts.]

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Okay I need to discard.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Specialist forecast, examine the top six cards of the draw pile, rearrange them in the order of your choice and place them on top of the draw pile.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Play anytime, it does not require an action.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: Oh I can play this anytime, should we wait on that?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: Yeah so we can pick who gets the infection next, like we can decide oh we should get some red people next.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: Alright, alright so what I think I’ll do is move you to this position right here.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: So this is one.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: that’s lucy

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: Oh I’m so sorry.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: That was awkward

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: that’s okay

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: that was sexist, um, so I’m going to remove one disease from that spot I occupy

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: Wait how okay.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: Did you have to discard a card to get me there?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: no it says you can just move to where another pawn is.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: I kinda think that if you moved him to where I am he could give me his yellow card and then he could cure it.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: should we do that instead?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: I think that might be better.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: okay.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Wait I was here though.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: now you are with me, she moved you to where I am.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: so i can I can also go hang out at a research station, is there something better I can do?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: well you can play another get rid of this cube, you can cure right.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: think that was four?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: that was four

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: okay yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: thanks for being so accessible.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: okay so share knowledge is an action, but you have to do it on your turn, because you have to give me those cards.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: Okay so now do this stuff, sorry I forgot about it

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: that’s okay, I forgot about it.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: Okay, so now i have two more blue, I have three blue, okay so I can bring you to me next time

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: I have to be in the city of the card I’m trying to give you.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: So I have mexico city

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: I’ll share my cards with you this turn and then you can share them back to me.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: that makes no sense, i just have to give them to you.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: We need to meet in mexico city and Buenos Aires, there not far away

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: Oh my goodness

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: so i just put that there, alright lucy your turn.

[Timer ends.]
[End of B’s turn]
[Beginning of R’s turn]
[Timer begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Okay, so I need to meet you in buenos Aries?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: first of all, we should you should probably hop over to miami, cure it, and then hop over to mexico city and wait for me

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: so that’s three actions, but that’s okay, we can’t really do anything else right now

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: I have a minute, let me look and see what other options I have
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Oh we need to build a research station, I’ll build a research station

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: do we, if we already have one in the yellow?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: It’s in the blue.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: good

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: I’ll build a research station.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: That was four so now I’ll draw.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: stressful


[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: the medic has a lot of pressure.

[Timer ends.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: one quiet night, the next player to begin playing the infector phase of their turn may skip it entirely.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Should I play it?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: you can play it anytime

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: should I play it now or should I wait

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: honestly i think we are doing pretty good, like things are under control

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: so wait

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: so hold on to it

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I’m just super worried about that

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: yeah, which is reasonable

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: and we shuffled it and put it back onto there, didn’t we?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: yeah we did yeah we did

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: so we are probably going to get another black one

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: it’s going to happen soon, yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: go with your gut.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I can get to algier within four moves and cure it

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: maybe you should work on getting to algier and he can keep giving me yellows.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: we’re collaborating, we aren’t supposed to do that.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: so should I play it or not?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: I don’t know lucy, make the call.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: well I don’t think we should draw the infection call now

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: okay, lets continue on.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Timer

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: yay

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: cause i have to do it

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: and then she can send them back

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: set the timer.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: One two three four five six seven.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: I hadn’t realized you were going to do that

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: you might have drawn it before, i didn’t.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]:So um, Cairo

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: right there

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: you have two now.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: Done

[Timer ends.]
[End of G’s turn]
[Beginning of B’s turn]
[Timer starts.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: My turn?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: I’m in mumbai and I’m going to move one, and then I’m going to make my way closer to cairo.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: One, two, three total, and then maybe I’ll just end on cairo, so that’s four.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: okay.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: Since your here already should you move me to sydney, over here, so I can cure the whole place and get back

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: ooh oh wait that’s bad.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: I’m like ooh look.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: Yes, umm this should not require an action.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: Um oh okay I can do this right now, lets do that.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: I’ll just move you there, and then we have to add.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: good call

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: but good thing you are there.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: Now it’s lucy’s turn

[Timer ends.]
[End of B’s turn]
[Beginning of R’s turn]
[Timer starts.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: sorry, not a good timer person apparently.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: should I move to where you are?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: no, there’s no point

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: so you need to move I need to get to.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: Actually I should just stay here because when you get to mexico city

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: it’s really just the best move, you know.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: What else can I do

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: Oh, I have four red, and you only need three
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: should I just give you three of mine for three of your actions?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: I think i have to be in the city that you are giving.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: From one city to another, all of a players pawns must be in the city pictured on the card that is passed.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: That’s why I want to go to mexico city, because then I already have four.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: we each need to give you a red.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: That’s a much better road

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: okay

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: but we need to be in the same places to give you that

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: but she only needs one more to get five

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: well i guess you can just move me.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: It’s okay.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: basically not doing anything.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: collaborating.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: She’s getting time down and that’s all that matters.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: Even if it’s rambling.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: we do need to build a research station in red

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: I do think that at some point we should hop down to tokyo or kyoto and build a research station and cure it

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: Oh, well that’s handy I suppose

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: You can just cure the disease now after this.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: I can’t cure it until I’m in, where am I in?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: mexico city.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: um

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Do you have more than seven cards?
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: You might have to discard one.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: one two three four five six seven eight.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Okay I’ll discard a yellow because I don’t need it.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: Um Which one?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: santiago maybe?
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Because it doesn’t have a disease on it?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: and then I have to do this.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: New York and Bogota.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: new york and bogota.

[Timer ends.]
[End of R’s turn]
[Beginning of G’s turn]
[Timer starts.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: alright, so I’m going to do a cure first of all.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Then we’re meeting up in mexico city.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: Wait we don’t have to do that anymore

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: yes we do then I don’t have to move at all on this turn and the research station up there

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: okay so that’s I did two actions.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Okay one, two, should I just hang out in tokyo

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: oh that’s smart

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: yeah, and then I’ll be there.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: I also could have moved one two I could have moved closer to new york

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: oh yeah, I have new york

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: then you would be discarding to move there

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: oh you can move me a time any

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: i can move anywhere on my turn

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: okay so that’s fine, sure, yeah, but I can’t do anything anymore, I’m out of actions.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: alright so let me try.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: um okay.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: And that’s good maybe, so maybe we can work on getting me blacks so i can cure blacks.

[B’s turn begins.]
[Timer Starts]
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: the robot uprising is going to be stupid

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: Or I can go to new york and cure it.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: Mmm.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: That might be better

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: yeah, because we can get rid of.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: Yeah that’s my actions.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: yeah
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Chicago and epidemic

[Epidemic card drawn]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so move the epidemic rate up by one, infect, draw a card off the bottom of the infection pile and inflect, that’s right inflect,

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: oh my god, hopefully its not, santiago?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: And three on santiago?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yes please.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And then shuffle the infection discard pile

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: and your about to cure yellow, so that’s good.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: that’s true.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I’m just going to give these a quick shuffle.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: oh take a deep breath

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh. I’m curious why, what the difference is between epidemic and pandemic.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: I think that pandemic is like the whole

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: pandemic is like pangea

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: yeha like the whole world, the whole world

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: weird etymology question

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so this is done, and one two three four five six seven.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Perfect

[End of B’s turn]
[Beginning of R’s turn]
[Timer starts]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Um i’m going to cure yellow, I don’t know what I do with these, just discard them?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: I think so.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: to cure, discard five cards.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Your pawn must be in a city containing a research station, did it, then that’s cured

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: do we still have to go to the city and apply the cure?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: no it says you can take them all away.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Stop trying to stop me from trying shit.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: And then I only did one action I think, so I can move somewhere.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: Should patrick and I be in, no he only has one red.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: you could go from chicago to toronto,

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: do this, then take this, and we can trade cards.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: Take this.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: We should trade blues

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: Oh yeah, and we are both in a blue area.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: oh sorry, I keep forgetting I’m not supposed to be doing that when talking.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: It’s really hard for me.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]’ Los Angeles, So if we get the same one, it’s cured, so do we just do nothing?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: oh

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: um, was it just only at that time?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: we have to ask

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: we have to ask, because we

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: I don’t know.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: I really don’t know.

[Timer ends.]

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: hey, once you’ve cured a disease and you draw a card from the epidemic pile, do I still put that color on it and we have to go back to cure it.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: so you just get to, when you draw two cards do I have to draw another card because it’s yellow

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: we have to go to the other cities first

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: oh we were supposed to go to the other cities first, I thought we were supposed to remove them all once we found the cure.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: okay.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Should we continue playing that way going forward or do you want us to do the right way

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: do it the right way

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: so once we have a cure we can get all of the blocks off instead of just one

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: so like now, I just just I can only do that one so I pull another one so I only get two.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Okay thanks
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: and another one

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: I knew it

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: new york!
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: We already cured one so we’re cool.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: alright

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: go for it.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Oh right, don’t let me be in charge of things I just like to break them

[End of R’s turn]
[Beginning of G’s turn]
[Timer starts]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: We are going to cure tokyo

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: yeah, you should put a research station in there

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: should I put a research station here

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: do you want to go back, we have one

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: yeah we have one everywhere

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: so i have one in shanghai.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: So I can move one to shanghai.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Discard a card showing shanghai’s gone

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: oh, she already has four.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: yeah, so you only need to get her one of your reds.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: And somehow somebody needs to get me their blacks

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: well if I give her one of my reds, then she can move to where you are, if you stay in shanghai.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: yeah, I think on my next turn, what I’m going to do is cure

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: at least one

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: at least one of these from where toronto I think?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: new york

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: New york okay, um and then I am l left

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: oh oh.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: Im allowed to, I have to give one of these up to go, you have two

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: yeah, but we have to give them up when we’re there

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: okay maybe i should

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: figure out how to get, I guess maybe we could focus on getting rid of somewhere where there’s actually an epi a pandemic

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: my turn’s over

[Timer stopped]
[G’s turn ends.]
[B’s turn begins.]

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: okay, yeah you should definitely cure one there, and then we need to meet in one of these places so you can give me cards

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay so toronto is getting cubes

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: your right next to me though so we could

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: but i think we need to be in the place for you to give me the card, like we have to be in chicago for you to give me chicago

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay go ahead with your timer

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh that’s ironic, I’m not sick

[Timer starts]

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: okay go ahead

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: okay one action, and then let’s do two actions, three actions, four actions.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: okay

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: okay do we want to just chat while we have time?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: so, I’m thinking if you would like to cure here

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: i think you guys should try to meet in seoul right?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: yeah, so maybe.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: Let’s meet in chicago, and I can give you three of these cards, and then you can cure it

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: lets, would that be four actions, oh that would be four actions, because I could give you london and then that would be four

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: I have a thought, what if you did one action and then one two three cards and that’s four actions

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: I think you have to be in the city to get the cards

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: oh

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: we would have to be in san francisco, and then we would have to be in

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: you guys have to meet in london so she can give you london, and then you have all four

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: but she needs five

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: oh that’s right well she might draw one.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: let me draw my stuff then we’ll see.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: But now i have

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: oh you have four, now discard, discard yellow

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: okay, and then which one of these red maybe?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: Or

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: taipei probably

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: these both connect with san francisco

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: or los angeles

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: get rid of one that’s easy to get to so I can get there if I need to

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: reset the timer

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: um

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: no we aren’t timing this?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: i know but we aren’t supposed to be strategizing

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: right, oh no do this card.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: oh sorry, tokyo gets one, and so does, good job guys.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: Okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: okay, now me.

[Timer ends]
[End of B’s turn]
[Beginning of R’s turn]
[Timer starts]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: So maybe I can

[End of video 3 (ex4_2)]
[Beginning of video 4 (ex4_3)]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: I’m going to chicago.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: or you could here to here.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: okay so that was one cure and then one move and then one cure and one move so that’s four.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: And then you’ll move there on your next turn uh and five six seven.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: But if I get one more black one then I can cure.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: I have four

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: we should meet in is Karachi the only one you have

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: moscow is the one we should definitely think about.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: Can you move me to moscow?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: she can only move you to where another pawn is.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Or if you have the city

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: Yeah I have the city

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: Oh you can move to moscow!

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: oh that’s right i can move to moscow

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: but let me finish, let me finish, okay I got both yellows, but you should totally move to moscow, baghdad gets one,

[Timer stops]
[Timer starts]
[End of R’s turn]
[Beginning of G’s turn]

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: No we don’t do that

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: first of all Im going to go to moscow, that’s one action.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: That’s one action, and then cure it, that’s no action, and then I still have 3 actions left.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: So and cure.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: Um cool.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: I’m also going to do the forecast thing

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: we’ve been through most of ours.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Get all the yellow ones.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: I mean actually can we just take the yellow ones out?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: um, none of them are issues, In general we aren’t doing to bad

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: well then

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: we’re doing fine, it doesn’t really matter, ill just put them back

[Timer stops]

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: and now you have to do that stuff

[Epidemic card drawn]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: oh no, first one on washington, so we have three now

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so you have to pull three, is that what that means?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: and then istanbul gets three

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: wait they get three?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: but then you are close by, but still

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: not ideal, bottom and then shuffle discard pile back on top, now i should have used my incredibly simple at the bottom of the pile so that way we could have

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: well it’s next time

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: well we only have two turns, cause we have to draw three cards from there

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: your going to meet me in

[Timer starts]
[End of G’s turn]
[beginning of B’s turn]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: So I’m going to go to london, one two

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: did i draw

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: you can just go there because I’m already there, so you can just move yourself to wherever another pawn is

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: great, now you give me your card, I take your card

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: is that a thing?
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: I think so right?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: yeah, so we are at london, so we are sharing knowledge

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: you could put a research station there and then cure it right now.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: so that is two turns, I moved you to me, took the knowledge

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: then you are going to build a research station, then you are going to cure it because you have five

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: but there’s no correct disease in there

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: but well we have the cure so we can move around and cure them all and remove them

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: okay let’s do that

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Im going to discard all of these

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: yeah you guys should try to discard all of these real quick

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: and then you will do that one, okay.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: Eh doesn’t matter, probably just discard it right away

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: well she does have too many

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: I guess i do have a yellow

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: we’ll see how it goes, she doesn’t need to discard any cards

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: the infection rate is three, so I draw three cards, Bogeta, santiago, and toronto.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: oh no more yellows

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: Oh I’m sorry.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: yeah so pull another one, oh we shuffled all the yellows back in when we shuffled

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: those two, oh we good.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: yellow

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: baghdad.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: oh okay good, you’re there.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [B]:I was worried

[Timer stops]
[Timer starts]
[End of B’s turn]
[Beginning of R’s turn]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: okay, so now it’s my turn.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: So I guess, where’s atlanta, is it infected?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: so you can just get rid of two cities

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: on the way you can cure

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: or should I try to get over here so you can give me a black card and I can cure

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: I guess you can move over and get rid of one in istanbul, so we’ll need an istanbul.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: no we’ll need to meet in one of these places so you can give it to me, so cairo?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: oh yeah because it’s one less

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: one, two, oh maybe I should go through there

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: yeah get rid of one

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: get rid of one and then that was, where did I start london?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: One two three four that was my turn.

[Timer stops]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: and then this stop.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: we’re almost out of cards

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: alright shit guys

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: we’re halfway through

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: oh and I only have four cards

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: oh perfect, I guess you can, I’m not worried about it

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: am I in, I am in istanbul
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: perfect okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so you have to go to

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: i’m probably going to stay, I’m going to
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: istanbul gets another one and san francisco gets another one.

[Epidemic card drawn]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: oh do I have to draw three now?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Is that what that means?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: three of these cards.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: and moscow, where’s moscow, okay, and now it’s you

[End of R’s turn]
[Beginning of G’s turn]
[Timer starts]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Okay, so I’m going to move over and cure it right, that’s one

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: you can build a research station right

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: no we already have one.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: What?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: I was going to say if you had a card for mumbai that would be ideal.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: no, she has one she only used four.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: I’m thinking I should probably, we’ll discard one and then um I guess I’ll move to mumbai and then I guess I can’t do anything
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: oh wait I can cure disease for free I forgot.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: And that’s the end of my turn.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Um, so tokyo, and special event government grant.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Add research station to any city for free.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: Maybe, i’m going to cure black next so maybe put it in red cause that’s where were going to have to go

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: we already have one in red

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: I know, but we have one extra one, but we already have one everywhere and we cured yellow and blue so we need one in red

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: okay, alright

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: where, mumbai?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: That might be good because I was thinking once you take care of the black, we need to meet somewhere in one of the red places

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: tokyo, jakarta, or soeul, ill put it in soeul, and then draw three of these

[Timer stops]
[End of G’s turn]
[Beginning of B’s turn]

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: ah go away!

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I opened my camera earlier, I was like what

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: cairo, and here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: okay that was you so

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: does somebody have some kind of

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: no I think we used them all up curing it

[Timer starts]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: okay, I’ll just go there, that will be my four.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: Special event, government grant.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: Ooh another one.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: Add a research station.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: we are out of research stations

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: alright nevermind, no fun

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: you can probably just toss that card.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: Insufficient funds, um, oh.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: So we don’t have to do all this trading

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: Yeah, that’s right

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: okay so that was two, one, two, then its cured

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: yeah but not eradicated.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: oh alright, blue we got to do some busywork.

[Timer stops]
[End of B’s turn]
[Beginning of R’s turn]
[Timer starts]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: okay, and now it’s me?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: so, I am in istanbul, oh shit

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: you go to karachi and cure

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: okay, do I have karachi?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: I don’t have karachi.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: no but you just need to be in a city with a research station and then you can just go there

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: is that it?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: One two

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: discard five cards of the same color

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: cure them all, okay so that was three moves.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: and you can just get one in and cure one, oh no you cant

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: is paris infected?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: I was just thinking the blue is our next, oh well.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: I think that now that we have prioritized getting the cures, we now have to go about eradicating, because I guess it could still spread

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: so maybe I should move over towards red?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: no I think you should try to move over towards blue, and you guys handle this and I try to handle this.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: do you want to use your paris card and just go there?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: and then your are close by

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: where’s paris?

[End of video 4 (ex4_3)]
[Beginning of video 5 (ex4_4)]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: okay, um I’m done that was four.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: Toronto and Chile.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: Okay, um Karachi.

[Timer ends]

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I feel like the way you said that is like you had a personal relationship with it

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I was just in Karachi

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Karachi

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: karachi

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: and saint petersburg.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Okay.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Go

[End of R’s turn]
[Beginning of G’s turn]
[Timer starts]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: alright, one cure, two cure, three cure, four cure.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: Uhh, okay.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: wow, you have so many cards.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Give her your yellow for sure.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: and then the last one we have to cure is red.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: So

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: we don’t really have any red

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: well now we will.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: Ho Chi Minh.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: There’s two, and calcutta.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: okay, that shall be my moves

[Timer ends]
[End of G’s turn]
[Beginning of B’s turn]
[Timer starts]

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: cure that shit

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: yep.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: so start, one

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: you can take them all because we have it, have the cure.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: so that’s all one move now?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: Great, so that’s one, then Im going to do two, three, four.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: Cool.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: And maybe we can keep the timer going, so red is our last curing priority

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: and you need to get there

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: and I need to get there somehow

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: maybe next time you should discard a card

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: and just fly there

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: or also, since you can go to where another pawn is, one of us like i could go to Jakarta because you already have five.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: i have tokyo, I can send you, well actually you can go to tokyo in three moves.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: Because lucy, I think you should start clearing up over here and I’ll move over here this ways as well.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: sure.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: I’ll go to tokyo and then cure here, and then maybe my next move I’ll go to seoul, and actually execute the cure at the research station, does that sound good?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: sure

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: so resilient population, take a card from the infection discard and remove it from the game.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: probably pick, who do we have a problem with.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: Maybe pick a black one?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: from the infection pile

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: yeah, she picks one from here so that we never have to, maybe you should pick karachi.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: I hate it when it gets infected

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: maybe, maybe moscow because then

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: oh it already has one, so it can’t get another one?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: That’s a good idea.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: Calcutta?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: well calcutta is on my way over there, and I can cure it for free

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: but then it can’t get reinfected.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: But moscow we get to.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: I’m wondering if I should do tokyo, because I’m not going to get there for a tab, and it has two.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: Im going to do tokyo, so they are resilient.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: So they are removed from the game, no more for you forever.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: good for you tokyo.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: That makes sense, tokyo is probably going to be the place with face masks and everything

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: so now its your turn

[Timer ends]
[B’s turn ends]
[R’s turn begins]
[TImer starts]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: so I’m going to cure shit, right.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: So one, cured, two, cured, three, four.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Um and then I’ll keep going.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: We are going to run out of cards

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: so we need to expedite our process

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: we need to start traveling places.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: yeah so if one of you wants to use your red cards, you go there, next turn I come meet you, we cure red, and then we just try to boom boom boom as quick as possible

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: cause I can do both in one move

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: yeah cause if you could discard cards to get places.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: that still counts as a turn

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: cause I was trying to think and none of my cards have shit on them right now.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: if you went to tokyo

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: well we can’t forget about these three either.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: Should I just knock these three out?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: yeah, because then you need five, right.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: Definitely I think you could knock those ones out, you could get there and do the cure

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: you need to knock these out

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: I could get over there, I could get to seoul and jakarta, I don’t know if that helps at all

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: you could go to seoul?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: i will definitely do that then.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: what if, you went to seoul, I went to Beijing, then I came over to seoul to meet you, and game you a card.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: We only have two more turns, we are almost out of cards

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: oh no

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: alright,

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: anyway I didn’t do a card yet right

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: this is like a trainwreck oh no

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: and i drew an epidemic

[Epidemic card drawn]

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: alright we’re fucked

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: yeah um, epidemic, increase by one

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: even with cheating we still lost

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: draw a card at the bottom of the infection pile

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [G]: we all piled up too many cards i think, there should have been more trading and flying around

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: yeah, i think I was like, oh we should keep them because we have to cure, but

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: yeah, i was thinking the same thing

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: and shuffle the pile and put it back

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: this is insightful for the city for me panicking

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: no they ended out all panic attacks

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: no they didn’t end out they

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: yeah, the woman started to scream

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: you’ll be a huffing pixel

[Timer ends]
[Timer begins]
[R’s turn ends]
[G’s turn begins]

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: um well now it’s your turn and you

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: well miami’s got three?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: Miami’s got three, so one, two, cure it, one two.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: thank you sir

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: half turn left

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: keep talking?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: yeah, let’s just keep talking.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: well, um, because

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: get rid of mumbai

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: jillian’s turn, can you discard anything to get over, could you discard something black to get over, do you have anything black, hmm.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: what are you talking about?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: well i’m trying to figure out how fast she could get over there, we were talking so we didn’t have to

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: did we cure

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: one, two, three, four, cure.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: Cure it all, do we win if we get the cure?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: no we have to get everything eradicated.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: It would be nice though, a good personal group goal, to get four cures

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: yeah yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: I think that’s good

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: let’s try for that

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: i think you should just get over there and cure everything

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [B]: at least the cures exist, and then people have to do some more work

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [R]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [G]: jillian, last move

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: one, two, three, four

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: you can’t cure without an action.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [R]: it’s all for nothing

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [B]: so sorry

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [D] [G]: well then technically you draw a card

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [P] [R]: i think it’s over now

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: Y] [B] [B]: that’s alright

[Timer ends]
[G’s turn ends]
[Game ends]
