[Players: B, R, G.]
[From far left, clockwise.]

[Start of video 1/7.]

[Start of game.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: when do i put these

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: but the yellows are more in danger of an outbreak
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so the blues you don’t have to worry about outbreaks yet but yellows you do

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: yeah that’s true

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so yellow’s probably more pressing now

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: i think with these we probably want to put them in places that are connected to the most places.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: you know like centrally located because they allow us to move from one to the other.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh the research stations, is that what they do

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah so like

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: right, where is the thing about research stations

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah because you can move anywhere with a research station, but isn’t there something to do with you can, your pawn must be in a city containing a research station to discover a cure thing.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so yeah that makes sense.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: alright so should players, discard a card matching your current city to move to any city

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so you can either move to one adjacent or can move to any one if you want to move, but you have to discard a card if you want to move like far

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: yeah, okay, I, so you only need four
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: so I should probably give you, and since we are in the same city right now maybe i should give you like a yellow and a red or just a yellow?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: either way yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: so that will be one.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah that would be one to give me one, and two to give me two if you wanted

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: only because I don’t feel it

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: she doesn’t have any, she only has reds

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: so she could eventually

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: but we would both need to be in seoul for her to give me that red.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: well i should at least give you these.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: I’ll give you these for now.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: it started something?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Well this is two of my turns

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: i can only hold seven cards, so i can only.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so yeah that works.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: if I discard one i discard the blue and then have three yellows still if i can get rid of the four reds

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: we’ll try that.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay so that’s two and then, god there’s so many rules in this game.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: God.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so you could still move to chicago and treat one of the cubes, and that would be the end of your turn.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So that would be like an adjacent city and then you could take away, i mean i don’t know what else, the other thing would be to like discard that card and then move wherever you want, but.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: oh yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Maybe I’ll just do that, since we’re close to there we should start getting rid of some diseases.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: I guess.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah because then you go from there to there and you are adjacent
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: and then we can stick together and trade cards around a little bit if we want to.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: that’s a good idea, teamwork.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Okay what color, I’ll be the brown one.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Unless someone else wanted to be brown

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I’m from Tennessee, I’ll be orange.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: alright.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: alright.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: you’re white.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: yes i am.

[Beginning of G’s turn]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: chicago, that’s two, and then.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so i think moving it is a turn and then taking a cube is a turn

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: oh, three four.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah so you there, and because you gave me two cards

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: oh yeah

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: now who has the second highest population probably

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: oh wait i pick two

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: oh okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: think that’s good.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Oh yeah now you draw two cards

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: and now i have to do this other infection thing right?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: city cards, only if you draw an epidemic i think, right?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: wait, most of them are city.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: But i think that every time you play the infector, after drawing the player cards and resolving the epidemic, players must draw a number of infection cards equal to the current infection rate, add one cube to each city revealed.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: So we definitely need to get these down to, I probably should have done that before I gave you two cards, but it’s too late now.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: oh yeah i didn’t think about that.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: because we need to get those down.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Okay so Bogota gets one

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: alright

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: and here.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: So [name] could, so if somebody had, it’s this yellow one, for example LA, somebody could just go, i could go to LA and get rid of one of those right?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: yes

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: yes.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: But then you would have to how do you go there?
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: You have to get rid of a card.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: alright

[End of G’s turn.]

[Beginning of R’s turn.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: okay so do I need to trade a card or I don’t know

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: its a choice

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah because we are in the same city, you could give me your red one, and that’s like an action if you wanted two

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: yeah

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: so we get up to three there.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: I need one more red to cure it

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: okay, and then

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: up to six cards, so i need to drop some stuff

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: when do we draw?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: at the end, when you do your four turns

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: then i draw?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: you pick two of those and then two of those

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: okay, so then I might as well, should I stay on our path?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: well you could try and go to

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: mexico city

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: no, well you could make a couple turns and you could go, one, two, and your third could get rid of a yellow
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: i don’t know.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: i’m moving here, I’m moving here.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Well.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: another black card is heading to, so there’s no point in going directly.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: because if I wanted to play any of these cards I could go directly there.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: right

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: but there all uninfected i think

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: well, that’s true

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so yeah if you wanted to you could get rid of it if you wanted to, but its probably not worth it.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: you could have discarded that card and gone straight there

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: someone has this one

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: no not yet

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: i think yeah we drew right after that

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: oh okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: okay so now you get to draw two of the infection

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: oh yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: oh yeah, and then so london, do we do two?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: one on each

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: okay

[End of R’s turn.]

[Beginning of B’s turn.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: there’s a research station already in atlanta is that right?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: mm hmm you might want to put one, also we have one two three four five

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so now, I can let’s see.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Treat disease, discover a cure, or fly to a city.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So I could go to toronto if I wanted to but it seems pretty, but it seems like a waste of a card.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Im going to up to seven after this but Im going to discover a cure somewhere, after I draw a red one

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: yeah that would be good.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: But you can’t even, that has to be your turn, like next time.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah I would have to wait until the next turn because I haven’t drawn yet

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: but don’t forget this rule.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: what happens if you have more than seven?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: then basically if i get, then im at one two three four five six, so Im going to have to discard something
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so it might be worth going to toronto just to get rid of a card because im going to have to draw two anyway

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: probably

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: unless anything else im within, i could go to mexico city but there’s nothing there.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: sao paulo but there’s nothing there
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I want to still be close by so let’s see, four things that I can do?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I guess i don’t need to do four things.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Discard the card showing your current city.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Ooh, i know what i can do, seems like research stations are kinda useful, so if i can move twice and then get rid of that and then build a research station that’s four turns right

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: yeah but i think we want to spread our research stations out right, because the advantage of the research stations is like you can move from one research station to the other.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Because if there's an epidemic here you could move

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: oh we are limited on number, i was going to say that im not going to use all my turns otherwise.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: But if we are limited on the number of research stations we probably aren’t going to.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: How many are here

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah we can’t

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: gotcha alright.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Umm, toronto?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Yeah let’s just go to toronto to get rid of that card
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: need to get rid of cards anyway.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: get rid of that guy.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: that’s two turns.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: you could move towards us so we kinda are in the same cities

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah so that’s two turns
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I could move here and get rid of this thing and we can be in the same city.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Cool

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: cool.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So that is four turns, and now i draw two.

[Epidemic card drawn]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Oh shit.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Got an epidemic.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: awwwww.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Boooo

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: booo

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so this goes here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: well we’re still only at two.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah and the most we can get two is three, because there are only four in the deck.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So draw a card from the bottom of the infection draw pile and infect the indicated city with three cubes and then discard the card and then shuffle the infection discard pile and place it on top

[B’s turn ends.]

[G’s turn begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: so now like these we need to definitely get to these cities

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: yeah

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: let’s see, maybe ill move later over to mumbai then go over to here and get rid of those.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so here’s the bottom, so tokyo.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: ooh i’ve got tokyo, so they just got three.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Put it in the top here, and then shuffle these and then put them back on the top

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: where can [name] can go to sydney from here, but from here, you can go to tokyo.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Oh yeah okay so go to tokyo and then i can.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so if im in the same city as anybody with a red they should give it to me so I can get rid of the reds now

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: ohh

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Ive only got six cards so i can do that first thing on my next one.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: oh that’s good

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: give you my red

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: next time so

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: make sure you move to my city, which should be easy since we’re right next to each other.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: mmhmm

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: and then give me a red and that would be two of your actions.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: that’s good because we really need to

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: and then get rid of that off the board now.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: However that works.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: yeah so i forget but she said that you can’t take them off once they’re there, so you can’t get more reds but you have to leave them there is that the.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah so I don’t really know how that works, what actually curing it actually does.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay so lets see

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so what if you draw another tokyo after you cured the reds, does it just not do anything?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: i think that’s what it is

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: you just cure and remove the disease from that city

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: back on top

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: is that what we think

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: i don’t know

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: i can see an outbreak coming.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: well once we do that then we’ll go ask her

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: if we get to that point.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: we will we can do it.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Let’s get that out of there.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Okay so maybe I don’t have a red I should go over to here, we’re going to get rid of that anyway.

[End of video 1/7.]

[Start of video 2/7.]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: so maybe

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: we just need to go there

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: but what if we get this because we still have to drop these, so maybe I should go over to tokyo and get rid of at least one

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah there’s a pretty high chance of the eight cards there that at least one of these close to the top is tokyo
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: we could draw it any minute.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: okay so I’ll go over there, so I have one, two, three, what do you guys think, four?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Should i go for it

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: mmhmm

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: okay.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Alright, ooh santiago.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: We need to get in the same city

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: to trade back and forth

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Okay airlift, i got a special event.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Move a pawn, yours or another players to any city.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: You must have the players permission to move their pawn and it doesn’t require an action.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: and I don’t think you have to do that now, they can be played at any time, so you can hang onto that as a card and play it when it’s most useful.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: and maybe, and maybe next time ill put a research station over here so we can jump to it.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: that’s a good idea

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: because i kinda forgot about those.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: okay so im going to do

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: you have to do the infection rate thing.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: moscow, bogeta.

[End of G’s turn.]

[Beginning of R’s turn.]

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: okay good.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: im going to move to kamchaka

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: ive never actually heard of kamchaka

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: okay so i need to

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: you guys need to get together

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: give you my card

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah but we need to get to the same city

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: first?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: so you have to move to him

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: wait no you guys have to be in shanghai right?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: so oh wait

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: that’s only me that can give

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh so both players pawns have to be in the same city pictured on the card
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh so we have to both be in shanghai

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: i’m the only one who doesn’t have that

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: that’s right i forgot about that from the start of the game

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: okay so im going to fly to shanghai

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: but no then you have to get rid of this and then you can’t give it to him

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah because you have to discard it

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: so maybe you should come to tokyo with me and give it to me and then I can give it to him when he comes to tokyo

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: ooh that’s thinking

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: okay so im going to do one two, three

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: and then four is giving it to me

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: oh cool

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: nice, i like it

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: ooh i have kamchachaka

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: nice so you can fly there

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: and you’ve got three blues now so your like on your way to get five cause you can cure stuff too

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: yeah if you have five, but i have two yellows, so if i can get these two to you too than we can cure two of them

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Wooo alright that’s cool, and then one more.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: one more, you have to do two of those.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Oh shit

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: uh oh that could be like a chain reaction

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: that could hurt really bad.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Three at once

[End of R’s turn.]

[Beginning of B’s turn.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: alright so now, lets see i can do four, how many does it take.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I can be in tokyo in two moves?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh wait, hold on.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Tokyo, so i can get to tokyo in two moves, so i should get rid of one of these
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: oh wait, im still trying to get these from you but i can’t get anything from you on this turn

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: no im the only one who should do that

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so I should do one, two of these and then move twice.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And that gets LA knocked down and puts me in the same city as you.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: does that make sense to yall

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: yeah, i think so

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: one two three four five six, oh shit i have to find a way to play cards.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: okay maybe you should, no we don’t need you to

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so i could fly to mexico city and cure it and get there in the same amount of turns?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: One two three four just to get there and play a card

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: but maybe it wouldn’t be that big of a deal if you just discarded pripyat, because you don’t want to go there.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah yeah you can discard anyway.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Can i discard pripyat?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: yeah if you get more than seven you discard.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: So its not actually that big of a deal

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: oh.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So i have to get under, i have to discard three so I can draw two and then you can still give me one.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And that only puts me at seven

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: yeah thats a good point

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: i need to just keep them

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: too bad, so i guess keep the red.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah keep the red, get rid of all my yellows and the black and draw two, or could i discard the two i draw

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: come to me and then you could give me one of the yellows you have

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: ooh thats a good idea actually, yeah alright ill draw, give her one of these, move to you thats three
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: and ill give to you, do you want sao paulo or mexico city.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Sao paulo gets you over here and that’s close to this thing, and mexico city gets you over to there.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: maybe sao paulo just cause that’s, but maybe we can get rid of the disease, the yellow one

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: okay so this will be red at seven cards, but maybe i can still discard one.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I got one of the special events, does that count as a card?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: then i have two four six seven, i have seven too

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: alright

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: uh no i think it still counts, because it says some special event cards can be played at any time, hand limit is strictly seven.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh okay so i see, this is karachi.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: where is karachi?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: india

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: there it is okay
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: one of these to discard basically, so karachi.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: yeah that seems like what you do.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: One two three four five

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah thats how we’re doing it.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: She says play by your rules

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: good job of following the rules so far

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah the special event card i got says the next player to begin playing the infector phase of their turn may skip that phase entirely.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: you don’t have to infect

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: okay, do we want to do that now or not.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Wait play at any time, I don’t know if it’s critical, let’s wait for it to be a critical point when it starts get even scarier, because we still have many outbreaks to burn

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: yeah i agree

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so london gets one and jakarta gets one

[Outbreak occurs.]

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: ohh outbreak

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: lets do one two three four five.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: oh shit

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: we should have gotten rid of two

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: do i have to put the color of the city on there?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Like where the city is?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: color of the city
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: where is the outbreak?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Add a cube of the outbreaking color to each adjacent city.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: of the outbreaking color to each adjacent city.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Oh that’s weird

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah your right sorry.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: We need to come up with a cure for the black

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: yeah we need to get over there
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: i think what im going to do is go over there and maybe put a station there so you guys can come.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Lets see

[End of B’s turn.]

[Beginning of G’s turn.]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay my turn
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: so now we’re in the same place

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: first thing your going to want to give me that so we can get rid of the red

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: can you get rid of that at any time?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Or no you have to

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: i think thats an action

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: how about you
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: that’s two
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: do you want to give me a yellow one while we are in the same place?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: that’s an action too isn’t it?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay, so I did one

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: you could build a research station

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: okay maybe should I get over to here?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: And where’s mumbai.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Here.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]:I could fly to mumbai and move over, take one from here and take one from.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: one, two three four.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Oh no you can’t move and play it but you can at least get there and then you’d be closer.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And there’s less of a chance that there's not two in the top handful of cards

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: but if we get another one of those.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Okay so im going to play this and go to mumbai, right.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah, only thing is we need to be careful not to discard all the black ones so that we can still cure it.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah that’s true.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: So me flying there is one turn, right?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: So now I’ve done two?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so now you can take one out of Shenai or mumbai.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: and do I want to move to chunai and put a research station there, would that be four?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah but you couldn’t take one out

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: yeah but i did one to you, two here
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: three take one off
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: oh yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: moving is one

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: i think i should go, what do you guys think should I take one from mumbai or take one from Shenai?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: take one from Shenai.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: I could do a research station, but i’d have to use my black card to fly.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: maybe you put a research station somewhere here like shanghai

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh you have to discard the card shown on your current city to build a research station.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]:So you’d have to have

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: mumbai?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: I have chunai.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: So i can fly there.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: but you can’t fly there and build a research station there, you have to get there first

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: you go there, I’ll give it to you on my next turn.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: but then you have to be in the city

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: to give it to her?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah you both have to be in the city.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Shit this is getting complicated

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: oh no, but we can start making our way
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: okay im going to get rid of one here and one here, because thats pretty much all i can do right now right?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: you can get rid of one there or one there because moving is a turn

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: i think here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah I don’t know how many of each city there are in that deck, so we are about to get back to where we started probably, because there’s two turns around before we are shuffling cards

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: so im going to, im going to

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: oh wait i have to draw

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah you have to draw
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: how many cards do you have

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: one two three four five

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: six

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: oh shit i can move my pawn
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: i can move your pawn i can airlift

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: airlift me!

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: you can do that any turn right?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: play at any time

[End of video 2/7.]

[Start of video 3/7.]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: okay let’s see what happens first if we can play it at any time.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: okay

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay, beijing, that’s one, dehli gets one.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: those are your cards these are infection cards

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: oh okay sorry

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: i was just like going with it

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay so now i have seven, now i need to do this

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: do you want me to do this

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: tokyo, oh yeah that’s good

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: is it?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Here is paris, uh oh

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: paris is at three

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: shh

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: forget paris

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: let them die

[End of G’s turn.]

[Beginning of R’s turn.]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: so okay i can knock

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: this whole area is starting to look a little scary

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: i can knock tokyo, fly to bangkok

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: i can only fly you to me, i have to airlift you

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: are we airlifting me out

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: oh no to any city

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: so maybe i should go to

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: yeah but then we can’t build a research station
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: but we can put one here because we need it anyway.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: What do you think

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so do you have a paris card?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: no

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: but she has a chunai card, so she can go to new york, atlanta, kamchatka
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: she can go to kamchatka and build a research station.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: yeah but this is like, we need to

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: then your at least in this area

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: then we’re good if we have an outbreak

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: yeah, but if she went to new york then she could go to here and to here

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: that’s true, ill do it

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: what do we want to do

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: new york
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: or should we have

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: no but you can’t build a station there, oh but you could put one in

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: yeah but i can put one in there, but we have one there

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: you could put one right in there

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: someone needs to put a research station over here, because if we can’t get to it, because you can only fly from a research station to a research station

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: that’s true, we kinda want it centrally
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: but nobody has, does somebody have a special thing
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: what’s your special thing

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: i cure once treated

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: remove all cubes of a single color when you treat a city

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: so does that mean every time you take one off you get to take all of them off

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: yeah

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: but you haven’t been doing that.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: no we have to treat the city

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: no im pretty sure treating the city is just taking a cube off

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: really

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: treating a disease, remove a cube, so you can just take everything off if you wanted to.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: so i could take this one off if i wanted to?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: treat a disease, remove a disease cube from the city upon being occupied.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: If the cure has been found, remove all the cubes of that color from that city, that’s when we get there, but she can do that any time.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: she can do that any time
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: oh yeah so she can

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: we missed that so maybe we should get you to a city with three

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: maybe we should fly her to paris, clear it out.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: and then I can just clear it out

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: and then that would be two
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: that would only be one action because to fly to paris is free isn’t it, and then you get to move somewhere else.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so you could even move to saint petersburg and clear all those two.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: If we flew you to here and moved you to here one two that would be four actions and you would get rid of all of that

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: ohh

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: and then we can build a research station later

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: cool

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: alright and im going to here, knocking these out

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: you have a good card

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: knocking out the parisians

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: and then so that’s my turn right?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: that’s one

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so thats one action, so you can move one two to here and clear this out

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: okay, one two

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: i say this like somebody taking over this, like that obnoxious friend
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: i got everything, just playing all three turns

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: so that was two

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: that was four because that was one, two three four.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Yeah that’s really useful.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: We have not been managing that

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: i just thought that we had to cure it first

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: no, but once it’s cured, anybody can do that

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: gotcha

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: so you get to treat red

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: but you still have the scary part, she still has to draw two and then do this thing

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: how do you have

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: six?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: nope this is yours.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh shit now she has four

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: nice

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: nice, so here we go.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: no but maybe we’ll get there

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: or on her next turn she could literally just burn her whole turn just give me four blues and we could cure it.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: okay toronto

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: ooh maybe we should do that, no then you’ll have too many

[Epidemic card drawn]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: noo

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: aw shit

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: outbreak

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: hold im about to play four, so by the time it gets back around

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: so we have to go, one, two, three

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: hhh

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: she can also fly to kamchatka and build a research

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: next time we should

[End of R’s turn.]

[Beginning of B’s turn.]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: or give me the four blues and clear the blues, either way we’ll decide when we get there

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: let’s do blues first

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: you can’t right now

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: it’s not your turn

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: oh i know

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: your just organizing?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: No, no.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: alright so is it my turn now.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: alright so let’s see.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Discover a cure, your pawn must be in a city containing a research station.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: oh my god

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: well lets build a research station in
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: ohh wait, where am i?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: you’re here, no she is here

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: did we switch?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Oh well.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Its alright we’re in the same city.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Perfect, i can just build a research station

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: but then you have to get rid of tokyo, don’t you?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: lets see

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: discard the card showing your current city to build a research station there

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh shit i do and then im back down to three

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: but it’s fine and I’ll just give you beijing, and it’s still a pain in the ass but you will have it and you just have to stay here.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: alright so i just can’t go anywhere, um is there anything else, anywhere else i need to go to?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Just like go there and back

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: no because there’s nothing, well i guess

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: i could fly to mexico city and then back, but then id be out of funds.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Ill just build a research station whatever, put that on tokyo, and then i’ll go ahead and clear one off right here and there’s not a lot else I can do.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So yeah, you don’t have to use all four.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: okay

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: She was very clear you could do one of four

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: mmhmm

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: umm and then we’re still not yet to the quiet night right?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: We just drew kamchatka and nothing else has three, i think we’re good to go.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: wait you didn’t give him, oh no you were in the same city so it was fine

[Epidemic card drawn]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: fuck why do i keep drawing epidemics

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: oh my god youre the worst

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: alright, increase the infection rate, draw a card from the bottom and place three, dammit.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: New york, alright at least it wasn’t one i already had.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: alright but look this is scary because if this gets an infection in this one and then if this gets more than three,

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah like we are in the same situation, well we were earlier so we got the medic over here so she can clean things up for us

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah, clean.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: im just playing like the same handful of cities

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: oh shit to give you my red though, i need to get to the same place as you.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh right you need to get back to tokyo shit.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And you already used your aerial lift.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: One two three four five, so it would take a couple turns to get there.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: one two three four.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: One two three four.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: But then i can’t even give it to you

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: ill get it next turn

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: but then i can’t move again.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: But you just get halfway and then I can move to you halfway this turn, and then I could move the other halfway to you on my turn.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: and then you could cure it the next time around.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: yeah, lets go here because i can build a research station and then fly to tokyo
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: that’s another one

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: but you don’t have a tokyo card so you can’t fly to tokyo

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: no but if i build a research station you can fly to another research station

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: oh that’s right, i should build a research station
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: that’s super nice, that’s huge.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: cairo and delhi
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: so i could go to delhi and build a research station

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: and fly to me

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: yeah and give you a card

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: all in the same turn?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: nice thats good, good call

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: and plus that’s a nice central location, i mean it’s not the best but okay.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: So i will if i do that its one, one, two three and then give you the card

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah i think that’s fair

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay so one, have to discard this and put a research station, two, three, four.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: killin it, good job

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yes

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: four five, and so you have exactly seven.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So you need to

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: i need to give some cards

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: you could fly

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: i have eight so i need to discard one as well.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Which one should i discard, rio, mexico city or london.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: mm

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: or i could go ahead and play this and i wouldn’t have to discard anything, and then you wouldn’t have to worry about drawing anything

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: the epidemic

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: should i play this and then you don’t have to worry about drawing anything?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: because we did just shuffle all these cities back in

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: we’re about to fix some things with your red, so we should

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: let’s go ahead and play that, that gets me down to seven cards and will get you off the hook for this round.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: I don’t think i picked up.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Wait, I went first

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: have you drawn two this turn?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: no, i need to discard

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: did i draw two?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: i don’t think you finished your turn yet, i was just playing that as part of the turn, cause you gave me a card so I have to discard something

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay, so now im done with my turn
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: i pick up two more
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: special event: examine the top six cards of the infection draw pile, rearrange them in the order of your choice and then place them back on the top of the draw pile

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: that’s really helpful after we just had to put them back in.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: i don’t know if you want to do it now or if you want to wait, but now might be a really good time to do it.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Just make sure you get like new york and kamchatka towards the very bottom so we have some turns before we run into them

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: hmm and put them towards the very bottom
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: is that what you think i should do,

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah put them on the bottom so we have at least a few turns before we have to worry about drawing them

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: one two three four five six

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: and hopefully we got them, because six cards is perfect

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: okay so, i want to put kamchatka on the bottom, and then new york.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: either or

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: probably

[End of vide 3/7.]

[Start of video 4/7.]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: new york

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: now there’s a really solid chance that if we don’t deal with those before they come around on let’s see, one two your turn, your going to get both of them
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so lets plan on that happening.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: You see what im saying?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah for sure

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: then we’re fucked.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, but we need to be like aware of that.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: saint petersburg

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: lets see, saint petersburg

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: oh malovona

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah we can put it towards the top.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: What about london, ill put down here.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Chunai we don’t want.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: not that big of a deal, toronto only has one, I think that’s a good order

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: yeah those two don’t matter

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: and we know where they are now, too

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: yeah we need to

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: im going to give you my

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: the blue you can give to her and she can cure with five

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: the blue?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: we still need to build a research station, but you have four blues, your almost there, but you have yeah you have seven cards

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: i want to give, you want the blue?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: well okay lets see, well my turn’s over so now it’s your turn

[G’s turn ends.]

[R’s turn begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: so i have one card i can give as a turn, but you want blue

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: i don’t want blue, he does, and you have to be in the same city.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: you should yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: im going to knock out

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: since i still didn’t get to i thought i was going to be able to burn these cards
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: i can’t take four cards

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: maybe you should fly to new york

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: you should fly to kamchaka and treat all of them with one turn, because we know it’s coming up

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: no you can do these three.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: But maybe after that she should fly to new york

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: and that treat all those

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: and that knocks it out?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah because by the time it comes back around we could get on those too

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: and then we can get more blues, or he can give you the blue and you can get more later or whatever

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: or next turn, or after i treat this you can give me all your blues and I’ll get four.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: okay so i can fly to

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: well you have to be in the same city as her

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah we’ll figure that out, alright whatever

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: so im knocking these

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: so that’s two turns

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: two

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: fly to new york?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Woah alright she is just

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: i like the doctor she is just like

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: alright so let’s return, so now she has to draw two,

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: whoop whoop, look it now you have four blue again

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: now these, toronto

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: we know these are good because she set the deck for us

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: okay

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: and then, sweet.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I like that little special event card.

[End of R’s turn.]

[Beginning of B’s turn.]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: alright so now i’m in a city with a research station

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: oh wait i have to get rid of this

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh because she used it.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Alright im in a city with a research station, so I can now burn these and flip this here.

[Red cured.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: and we’re actually not that far from eradicating red, even though it doesn’t even really matter.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: now it’s not a problem anymore

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: so now i could

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: maybe you should get close to her, like you could fly here

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: that’s what i was thinking.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Now lets see, where could i fly to?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I could fly to london

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: you could also just fly from this research station to that research station

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh yeah, because I don’t have to get rid of my card for that.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Umm that might be worthwhile, because I don’t want to use one action this turn.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: your not yeah so

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: yeah so i can fly to a research station,
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: lets see is there anything else that really needs to be taken care of right now, or is that our best bet?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Let me see, so i’ll use one action, so Ill use two actions to get to atlanta, and then three four.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: And then she can get to me

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: wait does she have, you don’t have new york anyway anymore.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: But she can give them to me and then i can give them to you

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: what no, as long as we are in the same city she can give me whatever she wants right?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: no you have to be in the city on that card, only i can do that

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: oh that’s right.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Let me see, but we could both get to london

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: what’s your special power?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: we could both get to london and then she could give me three cards, cause i only need four

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: she can only give you london

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh no oh fuck.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I have london, dammit.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I could give her london.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Wait so i could fly to atlanta, that’s two, three, four.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: That’s getting so close to london, because I could just give it to her and then she’d have five.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah but uhh

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: but then that would take like a whole extra turn for us to get in the same city

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: well maybe you should.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: what else do you have?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Washington?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Why not stay in atlanta.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: And then you can, it would take you two turns

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: but then she could only give you atlanta

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: ohh, yeah so that doesn’t really do as much good
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: we’d be better off getting to london and giving her a card.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Is there a better way to get to london then flying there and burning one card i need?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Atlanta.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Alright I’m going to go to atlanta, and then let’s see that’s two, okay if i get as far as toronto though, then on my next turn i can remove one, move to her, and then give her london and that would be a good turn
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: and I can still get rid of something

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: But she needs a sixth blue, because she needs

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: she needs?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: no we need to put the stupid research station.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: how does that work again

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh we need to i need to build a research station somewhere.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Hopefully she will just get over there

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: why, in order to give me the card?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: in order to

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: eradicate

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: to discover a cure, a pawn must be in a city containing a research station.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Im just going to get to london and build a research station in a couple turns, im not going to worry about curing toronto as much.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Im going to get to here, I can do that much and then next turn I can build a research station.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: yeah

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: and then that will have us there, and then she’ll be there.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: She’s going to eventually get a fifth blue, and then we can just discard other things until she gets one.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Alright that’s two.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: so you pick up

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Alright thats a blue, and ooh another blue.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So now she can just give me one and we can get to london or get to one with one of these things

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: there’s so many rules, there's so many

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: oh chunai

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: we knew that was coming

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: yeah

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: you could always fly there too

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: london, oh interesting

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: okay.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: we are relatively safe further down the deck for the next couple of turns because we got rid of all the stuff in

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: i can apply it to chunai
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: I can give you a blue and apply it to chunai

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: ohh that’s so smart then get rid of those, because then you can eradicate them.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: But he has to get rid of london so you have to give him

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: two

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: no but you can’t do that because you have to be in the same city alright well i’ll go
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: my turn right?

[End of B’s turn.]

[Beginning of G’s turn.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: because all i can do is give people cards basically.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah if I knew I was going to draw two we could have met in atlanta, but I didn’t know we were going to draw two.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And you don’t have any blues, so that doesn’t help

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: direct flight, discard the card showing your current city
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: you can discard the card showing your current city and fly anywhere you want, we kinda forgot that

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: yeah we kinda forgot that.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So where are you

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: i’m over here, i should probably fly towards you guys, or I can fly to

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: where else

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: there’s no reason for me to fly to algiers or cairo.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: do you have anywhere you can that’s within distance where you can build a research station

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: no

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: LA, close to atlanta
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: you could like go to la and build a research station, then wed have two more research stations

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: we need something like over here

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: i could fly to algiers, and then I could move over to cairo and build one in cairo.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: we’re just discarding more blacks but okay

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: have we done too many do you think

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: i don’t know, i don’t remember how many we’ve done
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I think we’re fine, that’s okay

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: what can we do, that’s okay.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: I’m going to do one, im going to fly to algiers, and then im going to move to cairo, one two.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: build a research station in cairo
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: works for me

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: well I could fly over here and get closer to you guys in number four

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: okay

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: just in case we need to

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: it’s not a bad idea

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: do some stuff

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: she has that flying item, if she needs to give you a card she can get to atlanta and you can like give it to me or something

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: so I want to

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: oh your turn isn’t over until she’s drawn the infection

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: oh i have to do that.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Oh, hey.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: i saw you got four,

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: now i got four yellows,

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: so if we get over mexico city I can give you a yellow

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: okay

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: but i have to do this now.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: One

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: now we are into the unknown

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: well maybe you should go over here and get into all of those,

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: or, if I go to london.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: wait i put it

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: if i go to london and get rid of the disease in london and give you

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: then he can give you london

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: two cards

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: the next turn I can go to london
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]; well I should probably go to london and build a research station there.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: so that cured blue, and we are both close to london.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So I can go to london
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I wish, yeah I cant find a way to give her another one, because chicago and san francisco are all the way over here
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: go to london and build a research station and then I could, so I could go

[End of video 4/7.]

[Start of video 5/7.]

[R’s turn.]

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Move to London, and then build a research station.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So you go clear it.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Clear it.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I go to London, build a research station.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Fly to Chicago, meet her in Chicago, she gives me one of her cards, and I can at least, oh no wait, shit, or I can give her my cards, and then she can give them to you and then meet her next on her turn.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah, cause.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: You see what I’m saying?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I’m basically the one who needs to be giving cards to you guys.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Let’s see, one, two, three, four.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I could get to, get to Atlanta.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Oh wait I have to get somewhere else to give you one of the cards.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: She can cure in Atlanta.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Mhm.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: What?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: We need to get her.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I need to figure out how to get you one of my blue cards.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Ok so come to wherever I am.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah but then I have to be able to give you.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: It’s her turn.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: It is her turn but I’m thinking like a turn ahead because she can go clear London first.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: And then.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Head back?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: And then on her next turn, treat it if I can get a research station there.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Like if she can cure it, if we can get her a blue one, and get a research station built there on her next turn.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Do you see what I’m saying, I’m just trying to get ahead like what she should do this turn.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: What do you think?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: I think clear London.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: But then I could also fly to.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: You should do that next.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: And clear Shenai.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: But then you’re far away from him again.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: And I’m close to a research station.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: A research station.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Yeah, you’re right.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I think you should do that.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I think, I don’t know, sounds good to me.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I mean, yeah we have like sh*t going on over here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: That we need to take care of.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I think I’m overthinking this way too much like chess.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Yeah, but it’s smart to think a few moves ahead.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Right.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: So.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Now you’ve used two turns.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Two turns.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: So now I’m gonna fly.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: So I have to play you here.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I’m gonna fly to Shenai.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And clear it.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Clear Shenai.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: That’s four turns.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Ok, cool.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: That was good.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Five, six, I have to discard.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: So I might as well do.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So you’ve already got that cured.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So it’s not that important.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Yeah it’s only really for flying.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: When in doubt, discard the grey ones from now on.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: You don’t have to put that.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Why?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: That’s when we do this thing.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Oh sh*t.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: I keep forgetting that.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So you have to draw two still.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Get a blue.

[Epidemic card drawn.]

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Oh f*ck.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Damnit.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Special event.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: You didn’t have to draw Manila.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Since you drew an epidemic, then you still only have seven cards.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Discard this one.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Like you don’t have to discard, you can’t go over seven.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Oh really?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: It doesn’t count.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah, exactly.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Keep that one.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok, ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I like that.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: So this one, I can take a card from the infection discard pile and remove it from the game.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: You don’t need to do that right now.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: You can do it anytime.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Cause we don’t really care about.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Now we know.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Yeah, so we’re good.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: No you have to do this.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And we don’t have anything with green.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: We have to do the stupid thing again.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Now the infection rate just went up to three.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: And we have to take the one from under here, right?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: From the bottom of the pile and infect the city with three cubes.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: So.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ho Chi Min.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Well at least.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: In Vietnam.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: And then you have to shuffle these, and put them back.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Including this one.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: That is some nasty sh*t.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Ok, so we wanna do, which one on the bottom?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: No, you can’t order them.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Oh, ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: You have to shuffle them.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: That was just one of the cards.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: You just randomly shuffle them.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: She should actually, she should use this card to get rid of Ho Chi Min.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: It might be a good time to do it.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Right now?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Can I still play that card?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah, anytime.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Oh, ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Because we have to shuffle them and Ho Chi Min could come up at anytime now.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: And that’s like.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Ho Chi Min, yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Pick a card from the.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Cool, and we’ll just.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Cards up.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Oh, yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I think you have to get rid of this one here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Oh yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: So many ways to lose this game.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: But we only have one more epidemic left.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: So that’s pretty good.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Yeah we found most of those.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: But now.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: We’ve only had two epidemics?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Three.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: I thought there was only two, she said.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: There’s four.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: But.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Alright.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So now it’s my turn.

[R’s turn ends.]

[B’s turn begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Ok, what am I gonna do.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So I’m in New York, I can get to London and build a research station.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: That’s probably like my first.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: But you need to get to me to give a blue so I can give it to her.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So I could get to, I could build a research station in Chicago, but it’s right next to our other one.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Or I could do one in San Francisco.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: But that’s like connected to Tokyo.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Right next to Tokyo.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So London’s definitely the best location.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Wait, hold on, where is this one.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Atlanta.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: She has.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I have Atlanta.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: That means that she can go to Atlanta, and from Atlanta cure the blue.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: So we don’t have to, we don’t need another research station.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Oh yeah, that’s true.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: That’s not that important.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: So.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Basically we have to have a research station in every color, and we have two left, so we have to put one in yellow.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Because we can’t cure yellow unless we have a research station in yellow.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So that’s a good call, one, two, three.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I could build one in Mexico City.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: But then I’m not anywhere that she could get to me.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So I need to be able to get to somewhere where, we need to be in the same city on the next turn, hopefully.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Mhm.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: And you have to have the card to give her.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Or she can give me.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Cause by that time it’ll be my turn next, anyway.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Mhm.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: If I don’t burn, if I don’t have to burn one of these, you know.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Let’s see, so she has.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah, she can burn as many blue as she wants.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: If I keep all three, then she could fly to me, as long as she can get to Atlanta, or she’s at a research station so she could fly to Atlanta pretty easily.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Cause all you’d have to do is go here to get to Atlanta.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Right.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: So maybe I should go to, get to Atlanta.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Let’s see, one, two.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I could clear one off in Toronto, and get to Atlanta in this turn.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: And then I’ll fly to a research station, and then fly to Atlanta.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Let’s see, so.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: But you wanna, you should.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: We can clear Atlanta.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: You should give me a yellow.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So what we need to do is, I need to get to Atlanta, you need to go to here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Mhm.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Build a research station, and fly to Atlanta for free.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Mhm.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So you can give me that Atlanta card.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Mhm.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: That will be three, and then I can cure it on my next turn.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Mhm.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: But I think you should try to give me your yellow one.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Like we’re close enough together, if you can make that part of your turn, instead of knocking off Toronto, you should give me your yellow.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: But I would have to get to Mexico City.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: You could be in Mexico City, I think you can pass one.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Oh yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah, you may give a player from your hand, both of your pawns must be in the same city but it doesn’t matter.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Yeah, I can’t give you one.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: You’re right.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So, I’m just gonna.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yep.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Cure.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Let’s see, one, two, three, four.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Now I’m in Atlanta.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Now you could give me anything you wanted, if there’s anything worth giving me.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: But mostly I’m just trying to get there for her.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Mhm.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Alright, so I gotta draw two of these.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And I drew one anyway.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Boom.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: But she still needs to give me Atlanta so we can cure it.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Mhm.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Cause you have to be in that city.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And then Bangkok.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Seven cards.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: And then.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Oh, we’re gonna cure another.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Now I gotta draw three of these.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh my god.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Toronto, good I just cleared one off of there.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Do another blue.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Do you have to put more than one?
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: No, just one.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Kinshasa.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Good thing she cleared that the other day.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Right there.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: There it is.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: And St. Pete.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Whatever, whatevs.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Cool, that was pretty harmless.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: We had to do it anyways.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[B’s turn ends.]

[G’s turn begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: So now, I should go and build a.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Research station.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Research station in yellow.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Bogota, I don’t have, but I have.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Sao Paulo, Santiago, and [city].

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I think I should go to Bogota and build one and clear it out.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: But you have to have one to build one.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh yeah I can’t.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So you could try to pick one.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I guess I could build in LA.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah, LA or.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: And LA connects to Sydney, which gets us.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Yeah, Santiago is the end of the line.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: So we don’t want one there.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Sao Paulo is a pretty good location.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Yeah cause you can get up.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: If you can get there.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Ok.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Why not.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: So I’m here, so I go one, two, three, and build a research station.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I think it’s fine.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: One, two, three.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yay.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Four.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Perfect.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: One, two.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Ok.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Now we have somewhere nice.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: How many cards do you have?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: But that’s just for flying.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Because it would be good to get to Ho Chi Min.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: But Ho Chi Min is out of the deck, too.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Which now she just cleared.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Woo.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Good.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: That.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Disastrous New York.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: London.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Oh yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Here we go.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And she just cleared it up right in front of us.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: I know.

[G’s turn ends.]

[R’s turn begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: So I’m gonna knock you.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Move here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: One, two, yep.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Three.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Oh no, save one for giving me a card.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Oh yeah that’s right.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Cause you need to give me Atlanta.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: You have seven.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I can just discard.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I think as long as you.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I can just discard one at any time.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: But not right now.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: We’re gonna break that rule.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I can discard at anytime.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I give you Atlanta.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I’ll just get rid of that card.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yay.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: That’s fine.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: We don’t need those.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Or I could get rid of one, it doesn’t really matter, I could get rid of one of the blues, too, cause I’m not gonna play them all.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Right, right.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: But you could keep it to fly.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: But maybe.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: That’s what I’m saying, should I keep Bangkok?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And get rid of.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Let me see, where is Bangkok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: It’s right next to here which we need to get cleared.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Oh, yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So I’ll hang on to Bangkok and get rid of one of my blues.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Chicago, it’s so close to Atlanta that we don’t need to move to Chicago.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Good.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Alright.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Now we’ve got a bunch of reds on the table too.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: We can use those to fly places.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Paris.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Put it there.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: And then.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Fine.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: One more.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: You have to do three.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Cause the infection marker.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: No here.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: No but just this one.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Oh.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: This one.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Bogota.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh Sh*t, that’s ok.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Because I’m close, you’re close.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Close to a research station.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: We can get rid of that.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: We’re almost out, but.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Mhm.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: But I’m close to the research station in yellow, so.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: You should stay.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Ooh, one, two, three, four, five, six, you have exactly seven.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Let’s do it.

[R’s turn ends.]

[B’s turn begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Oh wait, I still don’t even need Atlanta.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Cause a research station, oh it has to be a research station, I keep getting confused if you need the city you’re in when you don’t.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Yeah, there’s nothing about like having the card of the city you’re in.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: But, it’s good.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Yeah we should.

[End of video 5/7.]

[Start of vide 6/7.]

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: We’re done with that either way.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I forgot about those.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: And don’t forget about the one where if you’re in the city and you have the card then you can fly anywhere.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Cause we might need, that might become useful.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Oh yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah, so I could have kept my other blue and flown anywhere.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: We didn’t think of that, I just got mixed up with the rules.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Whatever.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: There are too many rules.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: I know.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: So many.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: We’re doing a pretty good job, I’d say.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah, seriously.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: That was only one action, we cured another thing.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: And now I can go.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: But maybe.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Let’s see.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: To Bogota and clear one out there?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: If we can get together, you can give me your yellow card.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Oh, that’s right

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: So get to me, and give me your yellow.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Yeah, that’s even more important than getting to Bogota.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: And then for my first turn, I can get rid of yellow because I’m in a place with a research station.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Perfect.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So I used one, two, three, four, just to get to you, just gonna skip over Bogota, then it’ll get to be cured.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I definitely can’t do it this turn then.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Cause I played one thing, two, three, four.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Where’s Mexico City?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Actually, even better, let’s see.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: No you can go direct.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: We can meet in Bogota and you can just get to me there and then go back.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yep.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: You can go direct to her.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: She’s at a research station.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Oh she’s at a research station.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Oh, good job.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Boom.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: That’s why you need more brains for this game cause like, it’s impossible.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Ok.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Oh wait, no I can’t give you.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Did I just give you Sao Paulo?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: No, I gave you Mexico City.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Yeah, you can’t.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Sh*it.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Why?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I can give you Mexico City.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: No he can’t give it to me unless we’re in Mexico City together.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Oh.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Why don’t you go to Mexico City.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And meet you there.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: She can fly to Atlanta and then over to.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: And then on the next turn, get back to you and then you can get back to Sao Paulo.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: It seems like a lot of turns, but we can do it.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: You can go to Atlanta, Miami, Mexico City, and take her card, and then go back to Sao Paulo.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: But I don’t need her card, that’s just like way too many turns to take her cards.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I need to give her yellow.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: No, yeah, you need to give her Mexico City.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Yeah, so I’m just gonna go to Mexico City.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: There we go.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Alright.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I feel like it’s so easy to overthink this game.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: And then on my way to Mexico City, I can clear some of Bogota.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Perfect.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: There you go.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Alright.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Ooh I just got Miami.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Don’t know if that really matters.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Alright so, LA is infected.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: LA.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Oh no.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: This is going to be fun.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Moscow is.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: F*cking infected.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I guess both of those cities are fine.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: F*cking infected.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I think this one was that city, right?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And then Chicago is also f*cking infected.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: And like bad.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So this is like a chain reaction.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Wait, I can.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Ho Chi Min is out of the deck, at least.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: At least one of the Ho Chi Mins is gone.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.

[B’s turn ends.]

[G’s turn begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Ok, now what happens.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: You have to go, I go.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Mhm.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Yeah, you need to get to Mexico City.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Oh yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: And clear one in Bogota.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: On your way.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: On your way.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: And then you can.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: I’ll clear two.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Cause then he can give you.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Oh wait, did he give you it yet?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: No, I can’t, I have to wait until her next turn.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: When she gets, when she’s there.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: She has to get to Sao Paolo, and clear.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Two.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Wait hold on though, what if I go one, two, and I give you two cards of yellow cause I can do that, that’s four.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Then you have four and next turn you go back, one, two, and play it.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Works for me.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Because.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Yep, cause Sao Paulo has a research station already, yep.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Works either way.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Does it work either way?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: What are we benefiting from curing yellow cause we’re gonna clear it anyway.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: It gets deterred earlier, so we don’t have to draw three and infect.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Oh.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Where as like the faster you can do it, the better.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: And do that.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: And then maybe, well I know this is thinking ahead, but it would be good if you flew over here and got rid of these.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Mhm.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: That’s fine, I can go to.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: San Francisco.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Delhi.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: And then one, two, three.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: I have.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: And get rid of Ho Chi Min.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Get the three out of there.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Or, cause you know what I mean, we need to fix that.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Yeah, I mean I can fly straight to [city].

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Mhm.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Do one, two, three.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Four, get rid of one.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Four.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Ok, so I’m gonna go one, two, and then give you two.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yep.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: But what if we get.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh no, we won’t
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: That one, two.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: So which?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: This one is way less important, cause this one has got a chain reaction, this one doesn’t.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Which two should I give you?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: It doesn’t matter?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: I’ll give you Sao Paulo.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah cause I mean, we’re already there.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: And.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Do you have?

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Maybe Santiago because we don’t wanna ever fly there, it’s in the bottom.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Perfect.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Cause he’ll flip that over, and then.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: True.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah, we don’t want a research station down here.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Hopefully.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Mhm.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Ok so now I pick up two, one, two, three, four, five, and then I’m gonna have seven, six, seven.

[Epidemic card drawn.]

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Oh sh*t, well, at least we’re done with those.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: My god.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: This could get interesting.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Cairo.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: I have to put three in Cairo, right?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Right here.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Ooh.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And we’ve got a research station there.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Holla.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Sweet.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: And then, now we’re.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Fly here, here.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh wait, so that was one, no that’s all, right?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: What happens next?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] PD] [B]: I think you have to draw two more.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: No, this was from here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Oh, that’s right, you have to put it.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh I’ve just been putting it here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Oh, I see.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Draw a card from the bottom, blah, blah, blah, discard the card.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Shuffle the infection, place it back on top, and then I have to draw.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Do we not have to finish out this turn of three there?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: No, I do.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: So you’ve got two more of these still?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: This one was from epidemic, from here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Oh yeah that’s right.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: I have to shuffle these and take three from these.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Oh.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Have we been doing that?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I think so.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Oh.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Let’s look at the camera, did we do it, I don’t know.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: We’re trying to do a good job.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Is she looking at us right now?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I should be putting these under the table, and hiding them, if I was wearing long sleeves, I would.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Do it.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Alright this could be bad news.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Moscow.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: F*ck, that’s bad news.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Yeah it is.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: That’s one, two.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: That’s an outbreak.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Well, it could be worse.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: One over there.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Two.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: London.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: We go to London.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: And New York.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Maybe I’ll go to New York instead of.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Could be worse.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: We need to take care of some shit, but.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[G’s turn ends.]

[R’s turn begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Alright, this is what I’m gonna do.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Fly to this station, knock out Cairo, and then I’m gonna fly to Manila, and then Ho Chi Min and knock out all of it.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: But you can, that’s five turns.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Let’s see, one, two, three, four, you get there but you couldn’t knock it out.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Oh.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: But then I can knock it out my next turn.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Right?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: That’s a good idea.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: And then you could go to Jakarta on your next turn and knock it out too.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah, yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Alright let’s do it then.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I go here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Wait but, hold on, with this red, have we been playing red.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: We never figured out what happens if you draw a red card and infect it.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Even though we cured it.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I don’t know.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I think you don’t put them.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I think you don’t have to place them.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: That’s a good point.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Well it’s cured either way, right?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: You still have to place them, it’s just anybody can cure all three with one turn.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Right.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And the whole point is to get these built up.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Cause otherwise you get like three of these done, the game is like pretty much over, you wouldn’t have to worry about much.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I still think they can get, I don’t know.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Actually, if it’s cured, it’s cured.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Actually, we shouldn’t be getting.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Getting outbreak anymore.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: But we’ve been moving our outbreak marker.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh, yeah he just did that.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I already did that one.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Should we, that might have gotten left out of these rules, the official set is back there.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: What happens when we pull a card that’s already been cured?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Mhm.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Should we go ask?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Let’s ask her so she has something to do.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah, we’re good, we don’t have to infect.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Oh really, ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: It’s cured.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Ok, cool, that makes it a lot easier.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: So, does it.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So that means we don’t have to put any reds or blues anymore.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: So essentially all the ones we just put down, NY, London, we didn’t need to put those.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So we can just take NY.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh no we can’t, oh yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: We didn’t have to leave that in Moscow.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: No we have to leave that because Moscow is black.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Moscow’s black.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: So.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Cool, right on.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Wow, that makes it so much easier.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Alright, so we’re good to go.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: So she can’t outbreak red?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: It doesn’t matter anymore.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: No, or blue.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: So maybe you should get to here or to here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah you need somewhere to start with, anyway.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Yeah I’m gonna fly with, to the, from station to station, right?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah so fly there, and get rid of those maybe?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Oh yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Like you said, yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: So that’s two.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: And then, I could either.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So now you have two turns left.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Oh, ok, I could fly to Essen.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Knock that out, fly to, and then, three, and then four.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: But we don’t care about blue anymore, we care only about black.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Right.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So maybe you should use your next two turns just to get to Moscow and then you could clear it on your next turn.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: We don’t really care about yellow either because I’m about to cure that too.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Oh my gosh you guys, I think we’re gonna win it.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I think you should, do you think you should just get to here and then try and clear those.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: So just stay where I’m at?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: No just move your last two to move to Moscow.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: No don’t clear it, you can’t clear Istanbul.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Why?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Cause that’s four turns.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Oh no, I landed there, I see.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: So next time you can start by clearing.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Ok but you have to pick.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Oh sh*t.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: You have to pick up two and discard two.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And don’t discard blacks.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: We’re gonna need a lot at this point, because we need to make sure that we keep four blacks.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Mhm.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Mhm.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Discard blue.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Discard red.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Yeah, for sure.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Which ones do you have now?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: What yellow did you just draw?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Paris and Bogota.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I’ll discard Paris.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Yeah, keep Bogota cause it’s got three on it.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Yeah, I wanna keep Bogota.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I’m about to cure it.

[End of video 6/7.]

[Start of video 7/7.]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: That’s true.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Cool.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: It’s getting way easier, now.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: But now we have to, how many cards do we have left?

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Oh no.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Clear.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Alright, so.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: It’s your turn.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Yeah.

[R’s turn ends.]

[B’s turn begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So I am gonna get to Sao Paulo and clear it.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So one, two, three.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So that’s another cure.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Okay.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: So I could go.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So the yellows are cured so that’s pretty safe.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So now we just need to.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Get up in this and figure this out.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: So why don’t you fly over here and clear something.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [R]: You can fly to Delhi.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I could fly, ok yeah, I could fly there for one.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Or, I could get to the same city as you and go ahead and start collecting blacks.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: If you get over to here, I’ll get over to here too.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Ok.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So, I used one, two, three, so I’ll just fly to Cairo.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Oh.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Or.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: You’re done.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah, I could only do one more move.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] R]: I would do Delhi, because, well.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: No.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: I’m gonna, I’m gonna.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Yeah, then you guys are closer.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: If you get to here, you’re closer to her.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: But what does she have, she has Kalkata?
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: If we get to blue and both get to Kalkata, she could give me that.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Mhm.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Alright.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: So fly to Delhi.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Perfect.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Alright.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Now, draw two, come on board.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Nice, ooh I got a black.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yay!

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Now we have four on the board, or four out, so we need to get them to him.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Yeah, she needs to fly to me, wherever I am next time.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yes.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Ok, Bogota is cleared, LA is cleared, Tokyo is cleared.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Ooh.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So we’re only worried about the black ones right now.

[B’s turn ends.]

[G’s turn begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Ok so one, two, three, and then I’ll give you the black one.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Ok.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: One, two, three.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: And [city].

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Sweet.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Alright so one more.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So now you pick up two.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Ooh, I have another black.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: And special card.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Government grant: add a research to any city for free.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: I’m gonna wait unitl.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Wait what.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Research.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Research station, oh, yeah, yeah, for free.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [P] [G]: So I’m gonna wait until we need it somewhere over here and just do it when we’re about to clear it, and then we’ll win.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Perfect.

[G’s turn ends.]

[R’s turn begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I’m going to fly to Kolkata.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: No you have to pull one here.
[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: You don’t want to fly to Kolkata using this.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Oh cause then I have to get rid of, discard this.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [G]: But give him that one for sure.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: I’m gonna do one, two, three, four.

[IA: Y] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Get to Kolkata.

[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: N] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Get to Kolkata, you meet me in Kolkata, I’ll give you the card.

[Running out of player cards.]

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: We don’t have enough turns left to get there.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: So how do I give you the card now?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Sh*t, we have to get it, we have to clear black somehow by the time her next turn comes around.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: You draw two, I draw two, and the game is over.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: We have to somehow figure out how to do this, we don’t have enough cards left.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: In this turn.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Clear, clear, clear.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Wait so, one, two, three, I could fly to you.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: And then give you the card, oh no, that’s five.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And that’s Delhi, who has Delhi?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: She has Delhi.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: We can do it.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: It might be, alright.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I’m trying to think how we could make this work.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: This is like not something that I was keeping a close enough track of.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Ok, so [name] you go here, two, three, and then to Kolkata, four.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: She picks up two.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Your next turn, you go to Kolkata, get it from her, build a research station.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I can’t get it from her, I have to give her one.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Why?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh my god, yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Ah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: What if she gives it to me?
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: No but we’re not both in Kolkata.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: And we’re not gonna make it to your turn.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: We’ve got to do this in the next two turns.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Ah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: You draw two and I’ve got to draw two.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I mean, maybe if we do it on your turn, we count it as a win, and get you, but then, cause I have to give you.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: One, two, three, four, you’re here.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So we’ve got [city] and [city].
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: If I get to [city], what if.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I can put the research station anywhere.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah, you could put a research station anywhere, so what if I use one turn to move to [city], oh but I can only give you [city], I can’t give you all three of these.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: And that would be enough anyway.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: You could meet her in Delhi.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: But we don’t have the card, so.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: No.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Somehow we need to get to Kolkata at the same time, but I.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: I think we’re.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I definitely was not rationing out turns.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: But what if we build the research station in Kolkata?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: And then we all?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Still doesn’t solve the issue of you giving me Kolkata.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: It doesn’t?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I don’t think so.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: If we’re all in the same place, wait.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Maybe we could fly to somewhere.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Yeah, is there something that could be said if we’re all in the same place?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: I don’t think so.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Damnit.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Where is this Delhi, nobody has Delhi, Moscow, nobody has Moscow, so we fly.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Her turn is going to be the last one because we don’t draw after her turn.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Technically maybe my turn will be the last one but we’ll let it go to hers.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: But I don’t think that’s going to make any difference at this point.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Is there any way that like each one of our number of turns can cure?
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: So I can knock out all of these.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I would say that’s not even an issue at this point, we have to get this one done in two turns, three turns.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: But we can’t cure it from just knocking out all the black?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: No, I don’t think so.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I think you have to have four or five of these.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Oh, that’s a good point.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: Yeah, there’s gotta be a solution here.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Let’s see, we have Baghdad, Baghdad’s there.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Basically.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Why can’t, why can’t I give you my card?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Because you both have to be in Kolkata.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: I mean, on your next turn, but by that time the game is over.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Is that for sure, if these are gone then the game is over?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Oh yeah, that’s like one of the.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: If you get, yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Player card deck runs out, outbreak marker runs out, cubes of any one color run out.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Ahh.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Ahh.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Well you never know, maybe you could pick up a black one on your turn.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: That’s at the end of my turn, after I’ve already done things.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: Should we just play it out?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: So we can fight until our last dying breath.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: God, there’s gotta be.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: Well at least we picked.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I needed to be in Kolkata already, like I would have rationed it so I would have been in Kolkata waiting for her but we didn’t realize these were running out.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: We just missed the gun on that one.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Yeah, we didn’t realize we were that low on cards.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ahh.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: We weren’t thinking ahead.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh well, we’ll finish it off.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: So now.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: And pray that you get a black card.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: But that doesn’t even matter because it’s like at the end of your turn, anyway.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: So I’ve already done all my actions or whatever.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Mmm.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [B]: I think.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Well let’s just play and then whatever.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: So [name], you can.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Wee.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: One, two, three, four.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [G]: At least we’re all together.
[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: That’s fine.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: We’re going down together.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: All in, so what city are we in?

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: So you pick up two of those?

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [R]: Come on Delhi.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: K, yellow.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: Whatever.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: It doesn’t really matter at this point.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Yeah.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: We infect the world.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [R]: China, nice.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [G]: One more.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Oh yeah.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [B] [R]: Ok.

[R’s turn ends.]

[B’s turn begins.]

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: Alright, so yeah, I don’t know.
[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [P] [B]: I can give you black.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Oh yeah, give me three cards.

[IA: N] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [B]: That doesn’t do any good.

[IA: Y] [PFH: Y] [TP: N] [D] [G]: Why, cause then I’ll have four.
